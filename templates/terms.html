						<p>These Terms and any dispute by You under them or relating to Your use of the Services shall be exclusively governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada and the federal and provincial laws applicable therein. Any dispute or claim regarding Your use of the Services shall be exclusively resolved by private individual arbitration conducted at Toronto, Ontario before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Act of Ontario.&nbsp; In the event of dispute or claim, prior to proceeding to exercise your right to arbitration, you must (a) deliver to Improbability Labs Inc. notice in writing setting out the basis of your dispute or claim and (b) participate for a period of no less than sixty days in good faith negotiation with Us to seek to resolve your dispute or claim.&nbsp; In the event of arbitration, the successful party shall be entitled to an award of their costs including attorney&apos;s fees on a full indemnity basis.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any order of an arbitrator and/or to seek equitable, injunctive or mandatory relief or order to restrain any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement.</p> <p>Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum shall be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitration, class action, private general action, consolidation of Your dispute or claim with any other arbitrations or other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity are not permitted and are explicitly waived by you, and an arbitrator or court will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims.&nbsp; In the event a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction finds the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then such waiver will not apply to those parts and they will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will likewise be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.&nbsp; To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or dispute under these Terms must be commenced and filed within one year from the date you notify us of a claim or dispute, after which any claim based on such subject matter is permanently barred.</p>
